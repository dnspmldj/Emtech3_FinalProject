Final project submission for Emerging Technology 3. The project that the team proposes is SecureSpot, a mobile application that integrates the smart lockers, aims to address the problem that happens in parking lots’ security, where car thefts and break-ins of parked cars are common. The team will focus on mall parking lots, mall parking lots are chosen because people usually stay long in the mall and that mall parking spaces are usually big and have many parking levels, resulting in fewer guards. SecureSpot is a user-friendly mobile application using React Native. The team plans to start implementing the smart lockers into parking lots for car owners’ belongings with features of smart locker integration, mobile application, real-time monitoring and establishing secure access that will be controlled by the user.
